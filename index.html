    <SPAN>HELLO WORLD. My name is Tadas. I am almost 35 years on this planet. Actually a bit more. Just like everyone else I was made out of what already existed long before those that are alive today can remember. This is my website. I know how to make things complicated so I wanted to learn how to do it simply. This is my effort to do so. Its open source. You can just copy and edit it to your liking.
